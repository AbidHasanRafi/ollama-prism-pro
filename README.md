After all models complete processing:

1. **Automatic Synthesis**: The system generates a consensus prompt combining all responses
2. **Quality Optimization**: The first model creates an enhanced response incorporating the best elements
3. **Error Correction**: Inconsistencies and inaccuracies are identified and resolved
4. **Superior Output**: The final engineered response is typically significantly better than any single model's output

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why does the engineered response take longer to generate?
A: The system must first process all individual model responses, then generate a synthesis prompt, and finally create the optimized response. This additional processing typically adds 20-30% to the total response time but delivers significantly better quality.

### Q: Can I use my own custom Ollama models?
A: Yes, Ollama-Prism Pro works with any model available in your local Ollama installation. Simply ensure the model is downloaded and use its exact name in the model selection interface.

### Q: How much system resources does this require?
A: Resource usage depends on the number and size of models used. For 2-3 medium-sized models, 8GB RAM is sufficient. For 4-6 larger models, 16GB RAM is recommended.

### Q: Can I export the comparison results?
A: Yes, use the "Export History" button in the sidebar to save your interaction history, including all model responses and the engineered consensus.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Models not loading**:
   - Ensure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
   - Verify models are downloaded: `ollama list`

2. **Slow response times**:
   - Reduce the number of models being queried
   - Close other memory-intensive applications
   - Use smaller models for faster responses

3. **Application not loading**:
   - Check that all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Ensure port 8501 is available
