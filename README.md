![Base Application Interface](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AbidHasanRafi/ollama-prism-pro/main/assets/banner.png)

When you first launch Ollama-Prism Pro, you'll see:

1. **Model Selection Panel**: Choose which models to compare (minimum 2 required)
2. **Parameter Controls**: Adjust temperature, max tokens, and top-p settings
3. **Performance Metrics**: View historical response times for each model
4. **System Controls**: Options to clear chat or export history

### Submitting Queries and Processing
![Query Processing Interface](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AbidHasanRafi/ollama-prism-pro/main/assets/query.png)

When you submit a prompt:

1. **Parallel Processing**: Your query is simultaneously sent to all selected models
2. **Real-time Updates**: Each tab shows processing status for its respective model
3. **Performance Tracking**: Response times are measured and displayed
4. **Thinking Extraction**: Models' internal reasoning is captured where available

### Analyzing Thinking Processes
![Thinking Process Analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AbidHasanRafi/ollama-prism-pro/main/assets/thinking.png)

For models that support thinking tags (`<think>...</think>`):

1. **Expandable Sections**: Click "Show Thinking Process" to view internal reasoning
2. **Comparative Analysis**: See how different models approach the same problem
3. **Learning Opportunity**: Understand AI decision-making patterns
4. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate which reasoning processes yield better results

### Engineered Consensus Response

After all models complete processing:

1. **Automatic Synthesis**: The system generates a consensus prompt combining all responses
2. **Quality Optimization**: The first model creates an enhanced response incorporating the best elements
3. **Error Correction**: Inconsistencies and inaccuracies are identified and resolved
4. **Superior Output**: The final engineered response is typically significantly better than any single model's output

   - Lower temperature (0.3-0.5) for factual accuracy
   - Higher temperature (0.7-0.9) for creative tasks
   - Adjust max tokens based on response length needs
3. **Hardware Considerations**: 
   - Use smaller models if you have limited RAM
   - Close other memory-intensive applications during use
4. **Query Formulation**: 
   - Be specific and clear in your prompts
   - Include context when necessary
   - Use technical terminology for technical queries
